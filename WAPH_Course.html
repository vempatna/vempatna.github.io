		<h2>Labs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Lab-0
				<p>Repository link: <a href="https://github.com/vempatna/waph-vempatna/tree/main/Labs/Lab0">Lab-0
						Repository link</a></p>
				<h3>Overview of Lab-0</h3>
				<p>
					In this Lab 0, we are creating a development ready environment in our VM by installing softwares
					requrired and doing some hands on exercises to get familiar with git commands and markdown syntax.
				</p>

			<li>Lab-1

						Repository link</a></p>
				<h3>Overview of Lab-1</h3>
				<p>
					In Lab-1, we embarked on a journey to comprehend the fundamentals of the Wireshark tool. Our
					exploration
					began with the analysis of HTTP GET requests and responses, examining scenarios where requests
					originated from both browsers and Telnet in Part 1. Transitioning to Part 2, we delved into the
					bedrock
					of web development, demonstrating the creation of a basic HTML page through CGI programming in the C
					language – an initial step into web application development.

					Continuing our learning journey, we ventured into PHP, a language pivotal in web development. We
					initiated with a simple "Hello World" program, showcasing its execution in a web browser.
					Subsequently,
					we expanded our PHP exploration by crafting an application capable of receiving data input. In this
					endeavor, we meticulously examined the HTTP GET and POST requests and responses using Wireshark,
					employing the Curl tool for POST request.

					In summary, this lab not only introduced us to the powerful network analysis tool, Wireshark, but
					also
					provided hands-on experience in developing CGI applications in C and PHP. The comprehensive
					exploration
					encompassed HTTP GET and POST requests, reinforcing our understanding of web development and network
					analysis.

				<h3>Overview of Lab-2</h3>
				<p>In Lab 2, we engaged in a comprehensive exploration of web development, delving into HTML, CSS,
					JavaScript, and jQuery. Through a series of hands-on exercises, we applied our knowledge to create
					dynamic and interactive web pages. The lab covered essential aspects of server communication,
					introducing the basics of sending requests to the server using Ajax. Practical exercises involved
					implementing diverse CSS methods—inline, internal, and external—utilizing external style sheets to
					enhance the styling of our webpages.

					A significant part of the lab involved practical demonstrations using echo.php as a backend server.
					This showcased how jQuery and Ajax can seamlessly manage client requests and dynamically display
					HTTP responses on the webpage. The integration of external APIs further enriched our learning
					experience. By connecting to a jokes website, we implemented functionality that refreshed the page
					with a new joke each time, illustrating the real-world application of Ajax.Additionally, we explored
					the Fetch method and integrated the agify website, allowing us to dynamically generate random ages
					based on user-input names. These exercises not only reinforced our understanding of web API
					integration but also provided valuable insights into practical scenarios where such integrations can
					enhance user experiences on websites.

					Overall, Lab 2 not only equipped us with theoretical knowledge but also allowed us to apply these
					concepts in hands-on exercises, reinforcing our skills in building responsive web pages, managing
					server requests, and integrating external APIs for dynamic and engaging content.

		<h2>Hackathons</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Hackathon - 1
				<p>Repository Link: <a
						href="https://github.com/vempatna/waph-vempatna/tree/main/hackathos/hackathon1">Hackathon-1
						Repository Link</a></p>
				<h3>Overview of Hackathon - 1</h3>
				<p>
					During hackathon-1, we employed an "echo.php" file as a basic server code with a request function
					capable of accepting both GET and POST requests. The hackathon comprised seven levels, each
					addressing and resolving security issues present in the initial server code to eliminate
					vulnerabilities. In Level 0, we attempted to display an alert using an input form, and in Level 1,
					we achieved the same result through a GET request by embedding the script directly in the header.

					Level 2 involved displaying an alert by receiving input through a POST request, utilizing
					client-side HTML code with a form to gather user input. Starting from Level 3, our focus shifted
					towards bypassing script tags and preventing the execution of JavaScript code when inputs contained
					such elements. For Level 5, we implemented code to restrict the input of alerts, requiring the use
					of the "confirm" method for bypassing. Finally, in Level 7, we developed server-side code to block
					any HTML code input and execution in the client browser.

					Throughout this process, we gained a deeper understanding of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and
					SQL code injections in the client. In Task 2, we implemented input validation and sanitation
					techniques for both the "echo.php" code and the HTML code used in Lab-2. These measures aimed to
					eliminate security vulnerabilities and enhance the overall efficiency of the code. Our approach
					involved employing various functions and patterns to validate inputs, ensuring a robust defense
					against potential attacks and injections.In summary, the hackathon provided valuable insights into
					code vulnerabilities and equipped us with strategies to mitigate security risks, emphasizing the
					importance of input validation and sanitation techniques in building secure applications.

						Repository Link</a></p>
				<h3>Overview of Individual Project - 1</h3>
				<p>
					This project involves developing a professional webpage that includes my name, headshot, contact
					information, education, and a downloadable resume in PDF format. Open-source CSS or Bootstrap
					templates are used to create a visually appealing and responsive design. Toggling email visibility,
					real-time clocks, and integrating two or more online APIs with JavaScript and jQuery are some of the
					functional elements on the homepage. A link leads to the WAPH course summary. The website uses
					jQuery to create a mouse hover effect and highlight parts in different colors. The skills section
					differentiates skill types using toggle buttons and React framework integration. Cookies remember
					customers and generate an alert message with a welcome greeting, last login time, and visit count
					for customisation. A page tracker records unique visits, providing information about the portfolio's
					popularity. The project code is hosted on GitHub Pages, providing simple access to my professional
					profile.
